This data shows how the competition has been in the gaming industry between consoles over the past decade(2006-2016). We can see Xbox is definitely the winner here where most of the games made for xbox are earning huge revenues(also the xbox version of the games earn more than playstation version of the same game).      

There is a huge rise in 2010 in sales of Xbox games (roughly because of the release of the kinect video game controlling system by xbox) and decreases after that (maybe because now the PC and mobile gaming come into play).However it has always been on top of Play-Station except early 2006-2007 and late 2016.   

Now,this data has only taken PS and XBOX into account and not other consoles like WII etc. and also doesn't take PC and Mobile gaming which has the largest market as of now.I excluded this as there wasn't much data about it / it was paid data and this data is till 2016 only.I highly encourage you to check out my notebook where every code has been commented for better explanation and there are markdowns about the visualization results in Detail.    

I made this project as i have been gaming for 12 years now and have a huge Knack for it :-) (and also obviously DataScience/ML ).
